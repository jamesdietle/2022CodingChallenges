        "- Nothing Written To The Disk: clients never write anything to the disk - not even temporary files (zero IO system calls are made) because remote imports allow arbitrary code to be dynamically loaded into memory and directly imported into the currently running process\n",
        "- Zero Dependencies (Not Even Python Itself): client runs with just the python standard library, remotely imports any non-standard packages/modules from the server, and can be compiled with a standalone python interpreter into a portable binary executable formatted for any platform/architecture, allowing it to run on anything, even when Python itself is missing on the target host\n",

        "- Run Unlimited Modules Without Bloating File Size: use remote imports to add unlimited features without adding a single byte to the client's file size\n",
        "Fully Updatable: each client will periodically check the server for new content available for remote import, and will dynamically update its in-memory resources if anything has been added/removed\n",
        "- Platform Independent: everything is written in Python (a platform-agnostic language) and the clients generated can optionally be compiled into a portable executable (Windows) or bundled into a standalone application (macOS)\n",
        "Bypass Firewalls: clients connect to the command & control server via reverse TCP connections, which will bypass most firewalls because the default filter configurations primarily block incoming connections\n",
